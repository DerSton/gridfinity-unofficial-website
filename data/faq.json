          "question": "How to cur down on printing time?",
          "answer": "If possible, use a bigger nozzle such as 0.6 because many parts of gridfinity are not too intricate and therefore allow for a bigger nozzle. Additionally, many maker spaces have 3D printers, which you could use to parallelize tasks."
